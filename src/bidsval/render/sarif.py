"""SARIF 2.1.0 output.

SARIF is the format code-scanning tools (GitHub, GitLab, IDE "Problems" panels)
read, so a SARIF report lets BIDS findings show up as inline annotations in CI
and editors. Each finding becomes a result keyed by its issue code; the codes
seen in the run are also listed as rules.
